# ðŸŽ‡ Story

Bryte is a platform intended for the
Software Engineering community,
making developers able to brand
themselves easily. We help them to
gather all the work in one place. Not just
the code, documentation, or the
technical view of the project but also the
marketing and branding aspects.
Alongside projects, their account will be a
customized portfolio to include all their
technical skills, participation, and
working experience so that you don't
have to create your portfolio from
scratch and update every time you get a
new skill. For organizations, their account
will include the projects they made and
teams working on it. We also allow them
to announce projects they need
developers to work on. And through each
developer's account, the evaluation
criteria have never been easier.
